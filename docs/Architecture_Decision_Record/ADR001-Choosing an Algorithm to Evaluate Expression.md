# Choosing an Algorithm to Evaluate Expression
## Context
The calculator must be able to evaluate complex mathematical expressions, includiong chained operations and parentheses, while delivering near-instantaneous results.

Here is 3 common approaches before making a decision:
1. **Simple left-to-Right evaluation**
2. **The Two stack algorithm**
3. **The Shunting-Yard Algorithm**
